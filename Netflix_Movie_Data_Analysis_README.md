Key Insights

1. Movie Rating Over Timeline:

This line chart visualizes how average movie ratings have changed over time, providing a historical perspective on how viewer ratings evolved across different decades.



2. Top 20 Highly Rated Movies:

A bar chart shows the top 20 highest-rated movies based on the number of votes received. This provides insights into which movies gained the most audience approval.



3. Average Runtime of Movies:

This bar chart displays the average runtime for various movies, helping to understand the duration trends in popular movies.



4. Number of Movies by Age Certification:

This column chart provides a breakdown of movies by age certification (e.g., R, PG-13, PG), allowing for an analysis of the distribution of movies based on content suitability for different age groups.



5. Number of Movies and Ratings Over Timeline:

A combination of a line chart and a count of movies shows the relationship between the number of movies released and their average ratings over the years, illustrating peaks and dips in both movie production and audience response.

Data Cleaning and Transformation

1. Data Cleaning:

Using Power BIâ€™s Power Query Editor, I performed data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting columns like movie runtimes and release dates.



2. Data Transformation:

I used DAX formulas to calculate additional fields, such as the average runtime and rating scores for movies. Relationships were built between different columns to allow for effective filtering and cross-referencing within visualizations.

Challenges and Solutions

1. Handling Missing Data:

Missing age certification and rating data were handled by replacing missing values with default placeholders or using average values for analysis.



2. Optimizing Performance:

As the dataset grew, I optimized the data model by eliminating unnecessary columns and applying filters to improve dashboard performance and responsiveness.

Future Enhancements

1. Genre-Based Analysis:

Adding genre-based filtering options to allow users to drill down into specific movie categories (e.g., action, drama, comedy).



2. Advanced KPIs:

Including KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for deeper insights into movie trends and viewer engagement over time.
